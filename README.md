# turtle-wow item database

Hello, i made this tool to generate a json/csv database of all turtle-wow gear. 

# How to run

Use https://github.com/McPewPew/ItemTooltipLogger. Configure it to log only names and toolips, and do not save as CSV and then scan all items id's. I did from 0 to 120000. You end up with a `ItemTooltipLogger.lua` file containing all item tooltips.

Bring the `ItemTooltipLogger.lua` into the same directory as this repository and run pipeline.sh
